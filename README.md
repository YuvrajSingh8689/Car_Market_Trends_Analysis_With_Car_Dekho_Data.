#Car Price Prediction : Insights from Car Dekhoâ€™s Sales Data
Introduction
This repository contains code and documentation for predicting the selling price of used cars based on features such as car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner. The dataset is sourced from CarDekho, a platform that lists used cars for sale.

Skills/Concepts Developed
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Linear regression modeling
Feature engineering
Visualization
Problem Statement
Given the car features, our goal is to build a linear regression model that accurately predicts the selling price of used cars.

Modeling
We use linear regression to create a predictive model based on the available features. The model learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable (selling price).

Steps
Data Collection: Obtain the Car Dekho dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features.
Model Building: Train a linear regression model.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance.
Visualization: Visualize insights and predictions.
Conclusion
By analyzing the Car Dekho dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the factors affecting car prices. Our linear regression model provides a useful tool for estimating the selling price of used cars.
